I would first like to thank my advisor Jan Adler for providing me the opportunity to work on an interesting topic and supervising me throughout the research.

I thank Prof. Dr. Hans-Arno Jacobsen for providing me an opportunity to write my thesis under the Chair of Distributed Systems. I thank my advisor for providing me valuable feedbacks and suggestion from the start to the end of the thesis.

I would like to thank my family for giving me the motivation and moral support. I would also like to thank my friends Suvash Sedhain and Niroj Sapkota for their constant support and motivation. And special thanks to my friends for creating a positive environment by cracking jokes and taking off the pressure during coffee breaks.
