I would first like to thank my advisor Jan Adler for providing me the opportunity to work on a interesting topic and supervising me throughout the research. 
\newline

I thank Prof. Hans-Arno Jacobsen for providing me an opportunity to write my thesis under the Chair of Distributed Systems. I thank my advisor for providing me valuable feedbacks and suggestion from the very beginning till the end.
\newline

I would also like to thank my family for giving me the motivation and moral support. I would also like to thank my friends for creating the positive environment by cracking jokes and releasing off the pressure during coffee breaks.
